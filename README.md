ObjectPoolerProject
Michael Douglas and Alex Musick

We have collaborated on a basic demo to demonstrate the object pooling system. The ObjectPooler script should be attached to a Scene Controller GameObject that persists throughout the scene. The object the designer wishes to pool can be assigned in the "Object to Pool" toolbar incorporated in the Object Pooler Inspector window. Setting the "Amount to Pool" in this window allocates a default number of the pooled GameObject. The "Can Grow" boolean refers to whether or not the object pool is permitted to expand at runtime.
